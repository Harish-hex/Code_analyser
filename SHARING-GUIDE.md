# 🚀 **How to Share Your Source Code Collector Prototype**

## 🎯 **Quick Sharing Options**

### **Option 1: Local Network (Same WiFi) - EASIEST**
- **Your app is already running!**
- **Others on your WiFi can access**: `http://192.168.31.29:3000`
- **Just share this URL with them**
- **No setup required from them**

### **Option 2: Production Build - BEST FOR SHARING**
- **Already built!** ✅
- **Located in**: `build/` folder
- **Ready to deploy anywhere**

## 🎨 **Demo Script for Presentations**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
> "This is a prototype for a Source Code Collector & Analyzer. It demonstrates how developers can collect, analyze, and operate on open-source code from various platforms."

### **Step 1: Platform Selection (30 seconds)**
> "Users start by selecting their platform - GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc. Each platform has its own icon and color scheme."

### **Step 2: Input Method (30 seconds)**
> "They can either paste a repository URL or upload a project file. The file upload supports drag & drop and validates file types."

### **Step 3: Collection (30 seconds)**
> "The system processes the input and confirms successful collection. This simulates what would be real API calls in production."

### **Step 4: Analysis (45 seconds)**
> "Now the magic happens! Users get comprehensive analysis including code metrics, security scanning, and dependency management."

### **Step 5: Operations (45 seconds)**
> "Finally, they can perform advanced operations like code search, refactoring suggestions, and performance analysis."

### **Closing (30 seconds)**
> "This prototype demonstrates the complete workflow from collection to analysis to operations. The UI is built with React and Tailwind CSS, featuring modern glass-morphism design."
